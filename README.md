# Youtube_adview_prediction_ML

YouTube advertisers want to predict adviews based on various metrics (like comments, likes, etc.) using regression models.



## Objective

To build a machine learning regression to predict youtube adview count based
on other youtube metrics.

## Lessons Learned

> #### Models
- Label-encoding
- Linear Regression
- Decision Tree Regression
- Support Vector Regression
- Random Forest Regression
- Neural Network


> #### Challenges Overcome
- data quality and pre-processing
  (Replacing the incorrect data in the columns)

- Especially for the column "Duration" the data provided is in "PT7M29S" ,that needs to be convert into seconds. By using user-defined funtion , that convert to seconds.

- Model Selection and Tuning (conducted a experiment with different algorithm for better performance, like cross-validation...)
